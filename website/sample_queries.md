How did HDB Help Seniors Age with Confidence?
``` 
HDB has enhanced two key schemes to better support seniors during retirement:

**1. Silver Housing Bonus (SHB):**
- The cash bonus for eligible seniors has increased from **$20,000** to **$30,000** when they downsize to a 3-room or smaller flat.
- Seniors must use their sales proceeds to make a one-time top-up of **$60,000** to their CPF Retirement Account and join CPF LIFE.
- Previously, seniors had to sell a larger flat and might need to make an additional top-up based on their remaining proceeds.

**2. Lease Buyback Scheme (LBS):**
- The maximum cash bonus for selling the tail-end of a flat‚Äôs lease to HDB has increased by **50%**.
- New maximum bonuses:
  - **$30,000** for 3-room or smaller flats
  - **$15,000** for 4-room flats
  - **$7,500** for 5-room or larger flats

Additionally, a new housing typology for seniors has been announced, integrating housing with care services. The pilot development in Bukit Batok will feature communal spaces, elder-friendly fittings, larger bathrooms, and other mobility accommodations to help seniors age in place comfortably.
