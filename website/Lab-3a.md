# üßë‚Äçüíº AskHR: Automate HR tasks with Agentic AI (Lab 2: Building a simple RAG agent)
    
## Use Case Description

This use case (in labs 3a, 3b, 3c) targets developing and deploying an AskHR agent leveraging IBM watsonx Orchestrate. This agent will empower employees to interact with HR systems and access information efficiently through conversational AI. 

In lab 3a, will build a very simple HR agent in watsonx Orchestrate, and enable it to answer questions based on a knowledge base. This agent retrieves relevant information from documents to answer user queries.

We will make this agent more powerful with more tools and access to APIs in lab3b, and enable it to collaborate with other agents in lab3c.


## Step by step instructions to build the HR Agent:

1. When you launch watsonx Orchestrate, you'll be directed to this page. Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner:
