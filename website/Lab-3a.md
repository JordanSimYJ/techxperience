# üßë‚Äçüíº AskHR: Automate HR tasks with Agentic AI (Lab 2: Building a simple RAG agent)
    
## Use Case Description


In this lab, we will enable our HR agent in watsonx Orchestrate to answer questions based on a knowledge base. This agent retrieves relevant information from documents to answer user queries.

We will make this agent more powerful with more tools and access to APIs in lab3b, and enable it to collaborate with other agents in lab3c.


## Step by step instructions to build the HR Agent:

1. When you launch watsonx Orchestrate, you'll be directed to this page. Click on the hamburger menu in the top left corner:
